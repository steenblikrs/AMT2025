# Architectural Material Technologies Commons

### Radical material responsibility through novel, regenerative, resilient, indigenous, and traditional materials with contemporary tools and innovations.

The "Material Commons" conference aims to explore the concept of radical material responsibility in architecture and design. By focusing on novel, regenerative, resilient, indigenous, traditional, and vernacular materials this conference seeks to foster sustainable practices that respect our environment and cultural heritage while empowering practitioners.  

The Commons as a moniker was chosen as a means of drawing from the concept of the Commons and that of the modern Digital Commons, defined as “information and knowledge resources that are collectively created and owned or shared between or among a community and that tend to be non-exclusive, that is, be (generally freely) available to third parties. Thus, they are oriented to favor use and reuse, rather than to exchange as a commodity.”  (Fuster Morell, M. (2010, p. 5). Dissertation: Governance of online creation communities: Provision of infrastructure for the building of digital commons.)  As such, this conference does not charge for admittance, believing resolutely in the need for the dissemination of regenerative and sustainable materials, practices, and design.  

Join us for three days of keynotes, panel discussions, workshops, an exhibition, and networking opportunities as we examine how to create a more responsible approach to materiality in architecture.  Connect with experts from academia and industry to explore innovative approaches to material responsibility that contribute to a regenerative and more equitable built environment.

Key Topics:
- Novel and regenerative materials in sustainable design
- Traditional and vernacular materials in contemporary architecture
- Resilient architectural practices embracing regenerative techniques
- Integrating contemporary tools and technologies with traditional materials and methods

Organized by R. Spencer Steenblik, Assistant Professor of Comprehensive Design at Indiana University Bloomington, in collaboration with the American Bamboo Society.

The studio had the opportunity to participate in FutureLab, an exhibition highlighting the work of design colleges from around the world. The list of participating schools included [University College London's The Bartlett School of Architecture](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/architecture/), [Politecnico Milano](https://www.polimi.it/en), etc...

From the "Part to Whole - Global to Local" studio the students models produced for the Empowered Living Design Competition studio were selected to be highlighted in representing Michael Graves College in FutureLab. This was a real honor for the studio to showcase the efforts of its students. Our work was highlighted in many media outlets.
